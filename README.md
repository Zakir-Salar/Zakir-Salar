### 🌐 IoT-Based Honeypot Network for Cybersecurity Threat Detection and Attack Analysis  
📅 Oct 2024 – Jun 2025  
🎓 Final Year Project – Bachelor of Computer Science  

Developed a simulated IoT environment integrated with intelligent honeypots and machine learning 
to detect, analyze, and visualize real-time cybersecurity threats. Focused on identifying various 
attacks targeting smart devices such as smart cameras, door locks, and sensors.  

#### ✅ Key Contributions:
- 🔐 Deployed multiple honeypots (Cowrie, MQTT honeypot) to detect Brute Force, DoS, MITM, Command Injection, and Data Exfiltration attacks.  
- 📊 Implemented **Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL)** for collaborative attack detection using shared IoT data features.  
- 🗄️ Used **Elasticsearch** for real-time log storage, indexing, and threat visualization.  
- 📡 Simulated IoT protocols: HTTP, SSH, Telnet, and MQTT.    
- 🖥️ Built an interactive **React.js dashboard** for monitoring attack trends and detection analytics.
#### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
`Python` | `React.js` | `Elasticsearch` | `Kibana` | `Node.js` | `Firebase`  
`Cowrie` | `Wireshark` | `VMware` | `mitmproxy` | `Linux` | `Ubuntu` 
|`MQTT honeypot` | `tcpdump` | `JSON` | `Shell Scripting` 
#### 📌 Project Duration
**8 Months** (*October 2024 – June 2025*)
